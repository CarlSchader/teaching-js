# teaching-js
A repository for teaching javascript from the textbook Javascript The Definitive Guide 7th Edition.

## Structure
Each chapter directory will contain an exercises.txt file with a group of numbered exercises. 

Students should clone this repo and put their solutions to each exercise either as a single named file (ex: 3-5.js for chapter 3 exercise 5), or if a solution is split into multiple files create a directory (ex: 3-5) with your code in it. 

Once you are finished with an exercise push your changes.

## Using Git
To clone the repo to your local machine run the command:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CarlSchader/teaching.js.git
```

To commit and push your changes run:
```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Some commit message such as: finished 3-5.js"
    git push origin main
```
